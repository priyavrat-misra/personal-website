## A Milestone and a Realization
A hundred commits. The number stared back at me from this site’s GitHub page. A small, yet significant milestone. That first commit, dated <time>May 20, 2022</time>, was simply labeled _{{<a_blank url="https://github.com/priyavrat-misra/personal-website/commit/d4cd7f7008809a3c39a4736aed14783000fae3ad" title="'initial commit'">}}_. In hindsight, _'humble beginnings'_ would have been far more fitting.

More than three years have flown by since then. In that time, my main area of growth has been the transition from knowing very little to knowing just enough to appreciate how much I don't. It's a humbling reminder that the more you learn, the vaster the landscape of the unknown becomes.

## The Origin
This site’s origin isn’t one of heroic start, but rather a slow-burn admiration for the digital gardens I'd find online.

For the longest time, I waited, caught in the classic trap of waiting for the "perfect moment." I told myself I'd start a site after I implemented that one thing from scratch, or after I had something truly profound to write about. I'd get consumed by a topic, dive headfirst into a research rabbit hole for weeks, and emerge blinking into the light, wondering what my name was and, having completely forgotten why I started. This website was my attempt to fix that, to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so I could find my way back.

So, I finally took the plunge and wrote a couple of posts. And then, things got busy, and this site sat dormant for two years. During that time, I explored so many fascinating ideas and learned countless new things. But looking back, I can only recall the few big things that made a major impact. The smaller, equally interesting discoveries have vanished. I didn’t reserve time for the trail of breadcrumbs to find my way back.

## A Journal
That’s a silence I’m now committed to filling. Going forward, this site will serve as my journal and who knows, maybe one day it’ll make its way into something like {{<a_blank url="https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/" title="GitHub's Arctic Code Vault">}}, preserved for future generations. For now, it's a place to log those smaller, fleeting thoughts. It's a reminder to myself that not every post needs to be a complex treatise; sometimes, the simple act of pinning down a thought before it vanishes is enough. It's a message in a bottle from my present to my future self.

## The Near Extinct Art of the Web
I find that personal websites have a very distinct feel on the web full of centralized and social media platforms. In this age, finding a personal site is like discovering a _Coracle Boat_ in the vast sea of the web. They are a deep reflection of what the author truly cares about.

I started this site because I was inspired by someone else's little corner of the internet. So, if this resonated with you, consider it a sign. Go build your own. The web needs less uniformity and more weirdness. It needs more personality, more passion projects, and more of what makes you, you.
