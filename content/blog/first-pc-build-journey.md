A couple of weeks ago, I learned that my laptop’s processor and the motherboard had fried. It might have sounded like a surprise to someone in my position, but to me, it didn’t. I had been using that laptop for over four years. I spent extended hours on it every day, some 12 to 14 hours. I knew I had it coming.

As a result, I decided it was about time I built a PC instead of getting a laptop and going through the same situation all over again. And with that decision in mind, my PC-building journey began.

After spending a few exhausting days researching the hardware, comparing various benchmarks, choosing the components, looking for compatibility issues and on and on, I finally placed the orders. It took me a lot of work to get through this step, but I enjoyed every bit of it.

#### Parts
When choosing the parts, my goal was to get better performance while staying within the budget of an average laptop. I was able to accomplish that with the following components. As for why I bought a GT 1030 in 2022, it’s because I intend to replace it once the {{<a_blank url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%93present_global_chip_shortage" title="global chip shortage">}} boils down. Until then, it’ll do.

#### Assemblage
After a whole week of anxious waiting, I finally received the orders. Since this was my first time putting together a computer, I made sure I had everything ready before I began. Surprisingly, that “everything” included only a {{<a_blank url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips" title="Phillips #1 screwdriver">}}, that’s all. That’s all one needs to assemble a PC. Also, another thing which goes without saying is "a great deal of concentration".

I took my sweet time going through the manuals in the boxes, and then everything started to come together (pun intended).

After having assembled a PC by myself, I can confirm that it is not as complicated as it sounds; still I did mess up once or twice. The first mistake was with the way I inserted the AMD heatsink; they have this projection on one side where the logo goes and this blocked a RAM slot. Due to which, I had to remove the heatsink, where the second mistake came in.

While removing, the CPU came off with it unexpectedly. It shouldn't have happened since there is a lock in the motherboard which holds the CPU. Until now, I’m unable to figure out if it’s because of a forced pull or a tighter adhesion by the thermal paste or both. I felt a heart attack for a moment, thinking I had ruined the CPU pins and the motherboard’s lock. I couldn’t confirm it until after 24 hours when I received the final missing piece in the puzzle, the {{<a_blank url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface" title="DVI cable">}}. Fortunately, neither of these scenarios had occurred, and it booted!

#### Final Thoughts
I would highly recommend building your own PC if you get the chance. It takes a little research and time, but it’s incredibly rewarding. As a final note, I am glad I decided to embark on this journey.
