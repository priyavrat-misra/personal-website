A couple of weeks ago, I learned that my laptop's processor and the motherboard had fried. It might have sounded like a surprise to someone in my position, but to me, it didn't. I had been using that laptop for over 4 years, every day I spent extended hours on it, some 12 to 14 hours. I knew I had it coming.

As a result, I decided it was about time I built a PC instead of getting a laptop and going through the same situation all over again. And with that decision in mind, my PC-building journey began.

After spending a few exhausting days researching about the hardwares, comparing various benchmarks, choosing the components, looking for compatibilty issues and on and on, I finally placed the orders. It took me a lot of work to get through this step, but I enjoyed each and every step of it.

#### Parts
When choosing the parts, my goal was to get better performance while staying within the budget of an average laptop. I was able to accomplish that with the following components. As for why I bought a GT 1030 in 2022, it's because I intend to replace it once the {{<a_blank url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%93present_global_chip_shortage" title="global chip shortage">}} boils down. Until then, it'll do.

#### Assemblage
After a whole week of anxious waiting, I finally received the orders. Since this was my first time putting together a computer, I made sure I had everything ready before I began. Surprisingly, that "everything" included only a {{<a_blank url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Phillips" title="Phillips #1 screwdriver">}}, that's all. That's all one needs to assemble a PC. Also another thing that goes without saying, a great deal of concentration.

I took my sweet time going through the manuals provided in the boxes, and then everything started to come together (pun intended).
