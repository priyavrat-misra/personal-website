# About
A Software Engineer with a passion for the submerged 90% of the iceberg.

I love writing clean, efficient code (_in Vim, obviously_) and geeking out over system internals, whether it's operating, database, or distributed systems. I document my findings in [my blog](/blog), but admittedly less than I'd like to.

Oh, and I pedal to work. Say hi if you see me. I'm the one in the shiny orange helmet.
