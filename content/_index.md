#### About
I'm a Computer Science graduate with an eagerness to implement things from scratch. In my opinion, it is the best way to learn something new and it is the reason why one of my traits is to properly research the inner workings of things before moving on to the next.

I'm very much enthusiatic about Deep Learning, Computer Vision and the concepts surrounding Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, to name but a few. Finally, I love open-source software and have contributed to a few of them.
