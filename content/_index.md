#### About
A Computer Science graduate with a passion for implementing things from scratch. A typical default behavior of his is to spend a lot of time investigating the inner workings of things before moving on to the next. He believes that one can only really understand something once they're able to implement it by themselves. Furthermore, he always asks himself, "Can I do better?" whether it be while writing code or performing a real-world task.

Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning fascinate him, and he has always had a keen interest in training models. His interests also extend to studying the concepts of Algorithms, Operating Systems and Computer Architecture, and appreciating the decades of innovation that went into these meticulous concepts. As a final note, he enjoys Open Source Softwares, and has contributed to a few of them.
