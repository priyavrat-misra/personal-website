## About
Hey there! I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Computer Science and a love for all things code. When I’m not writing performant, efficient, clean code (_using Vim obviously_), you’ll probably catch me geeking out over operating systems, computer architecture, and anything that gives me a deeper understanding of how things tick. Furthermore, I have a particular soft spot for accessibility, because I believe great tech should be accessible to everyone!

My personal coding projects often involve interesting algorithms—anything that makes my brain work a little harder, I’m game! I usually document these adventures on my blog, where I aim to break down complex concepts and showcase my learning with visualizations that make sense to both new and seasoned developers.

On the side, I’m an avid cyclist—so much so that I pedal to work, rain or shine.

That's me in a nutshell: a coder with a passion for learning, sharing, and pedaling. Thanks for stopping by!
