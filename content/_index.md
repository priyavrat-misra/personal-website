#### About
Hey there! I'm a full-stack web developer with a background in Computer Science, and I’m always on the lookout for ways to make things more efficient—whether it's diving deep into low-level programming or implementing elegant design patterns. I have a particular soft spot for accessibility, because great tech should be accessible to everyone!

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably catch me geeking out over operating systems, computer architecture, or refining my C++ skills (_yes, I like to live on the edge sometimes_). I’m also a Vim enthusiast (_because who needs a mouse anyway?_) and enjoy writing performant code that’s as fast as it is clean.

My personal coding projects often involve interesting algorithms—anything that makes my brain work a little harder, I’m game! I often document these adventures on my blog, where I aim to break down complex concepts and showcase my learning with visualizations that make sense to both new and experienced developers.

On the side, I’m an avid cyclist. So much so that I pedal to work, rain or shine.

That's me in a nutshell - a coder with a passion for learning, sharing, and pedalling. Thanks for stopping by!
