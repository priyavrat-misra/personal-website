#### About
A Computer Science graduate, eager to implement things from scratch. His default behavior is to spend a lot of time researching the inner workings of things before moving on to the next. In his opinion, one can only truly understand something once they are able to apply it by themselves. Furthermore, he always asks himself, "Can I do better?" whether it be while writing code or performing a real-world task.

Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning intrigue him; he has always had a keen interest in training Deep Neural Networks. He also enjoys learning and applying the theories surrounding Algorithms, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture as he is very enthusiastic about High-Performance Computing. Finally, he appreciates Open Source software and has contributed to a few of them.
